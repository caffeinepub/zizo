  "summary": "Diff implements unified image+video feed items on backend and frontend, adds authenticated upload UI with caption and progress, and adds PWA manifest + service worker registration with safe-area/mobile viewport CSS. However, backend migration does not preserve existing feed items/like counts, and required app icon image assets are not shown as added.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Add a conditional Motoko migration that preserves existing stored feed items and like counts during upgrade when state shape changes for mixed media.",
      "reason": "The added migration returns an empty feedItems list and does not transform OldVideo entries into NewFeedItem entries; like counts and existing feed content would not be preserved. Also no evidence of conditional/\"only when needed\" logic is shown.",
