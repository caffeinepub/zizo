  "summary": "Most requested functional changes appear implemented: backend addMedia now accepts optional captions and stores empty string when null; frontend upload pipeline no longer requires captions; video “edits” preserve the original file to avoid JPEG conversion and audio stripping; and new in-feed play/pause + mute/unmute overlay controls were added with video lifecycle handling to reduce playback issues. The only requirement not verifiable/implementable from code diff is the build/deploy rerun.",

      "id": "REQ-38",
      "requirement": "Re-run the full build and deployment so the updated frontend and backend are compiled and the deployed app reflects the fixes.",

      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff>: No build/deploy scripts, pipeline changes, or deployment artifacts shown"
