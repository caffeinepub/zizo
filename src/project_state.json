  "summary": "Expand ZIZO to include a full TikTok-style comments system (backend-persisted, visible to all users, supporting rich content) and a full share feature with per-post unique shareable links that deep-link into the app by opening the main feed and auto-scrolling to the linked post.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Target platform is web (React) rather than Expo/React Native.",
    "Core experience: vertical, full-screen, swipe/scroll paging video feed (TikTok-style).",
    "Backend should be implemented as a canister (for the like API and feed metadata).",
    "Search must query across both captions and creator handles and return mixed media (video+image) results.",
    "Implement in-browser media capture and editing (camera access + client-side crop/trim/text/filters) for upload flow.",
    "Security flow includes risk-triggered PIN challenge plus security questions and device confirmation; no email-based verification.",
    "Add a visible in-app PWA install entry point: an “Install/Download App” button inside the Settings menu in the top bar.",
    "Add user account settings UI/flow to update profile fields plus credential changes (PIN/password) and identifiers (username/handle).",
    "APK/Play Store distribution can be achieved by wrapping the PWA (e.g., Bubblewrap/PWABuilder); requires store listing assets (icons/screenshots) and stable public app URL.",
    "APK/PWA wrappers will only work if the deployed public app URL loads correctly in a normal browser; resolve any canister routing/asset serving issues before generating an APK."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Uploads provide no success/progress feedback and uploaded posts are not visible after uploading.",
    "Feed can appear completely empty (no older posts displayed), indicating a feed loading/fetch/rendering failure.",
    "Build/implementation attempt failed (\"AI couldn't implement that\"), blocking generation of a public app link/APK until a successful build completes.",
    "Deployed public app URL (icp0) fails to load (blank / \"Canister ID Not Resolved\"), causing APK wrappers to show only the link/ads instead of the app/login.",
    "Frontend production HTML is referencing /src/main.tsx (source entry) instead of the built Vite bundle, preventing the app from loading on the icp0 URL.",
    "Accessing the deployed icp0 URL returns: \"The gateway couldn't determine the destination canister for this request. Ensure the request includes a valid canister ID or uses a recognized domain\" (frontend canister routing/asset serving still failing).",
    "Caption is currently required on upload; it should be optional.",
    "Uploaded videos have no audio track after upload even though originals contain audio.",
    "All uploaded videos freeze part-way through playback and won’t replay/continue.",
    "Comment and Share buttons currently show a \"Coming soon\" placeholder for all posts; real comments + share flows are not implemented."
